This project was created as an extension of the BombJack Final Project from CSSE220.
We set out to provide a network multiplayer system for the game.

To install the project:
    - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on windows (WSL is iffy)
    - Open Visual Studio Code and open the project
    - Ensure that the "Extension Pack for Java" by Microsoft is installed
    - Install Eclipse Temurin version 8.0.412 from https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8&os=windows

To run the game:
    - Navigate to src\mainApp
    - Click on MainApp.java
    - Click on "Play Button" in upper right hand corner. 

To connect to a server:
    - Have the host click the button "Host a Server"
    - The client should click "Settings" then click into the IP Address box
    - Change the IP Address (and port if applicable, set by default or in the host settings) to the IP address of the Hosting machine
    - Click "Go Back"
    - Click "Connect to Server"
